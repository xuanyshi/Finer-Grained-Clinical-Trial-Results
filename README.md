# Finer-Grained Representation of CT Results

This work has been published on Scientific Data : https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02869-7

Full dataset was deposited to Figshare: Shi, X., & Du, J. Constructing a finer-grained representation of clinical trial results from ClinicalTrials.gov, Figshare, https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6860254.v1

## biobert_evaluation

```biobert_validation.xlsx```: mannually annotated data and validation of BioBert method used to separating intervention arms vs. comparator arms.

## notebooks

```ctgov_fulldata_for_github.ipynb```: notebook for extracting results from raw XML files from ClinicalTrials.gov

```arm_level_rct_for_github.ipynb```: notebook for building arm level relatioonships of efficacy and safety(serious adverse events) results

We are working on provide more concise codes for reproduction and clarity.
